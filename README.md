# April: The Future of DrivenData Competitions

This repository contains the source code for the April "AI chatbot" demo from DrivenData's [2023 April Fools' Day joke](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/183/future-of-drivendata-april/). You can also check out our [blog post](https://driven.co/blog/april-ai-chatbot) which has some discussion about how we created this demo.

For easy previewing, the style and script components are embedded in the [`index.html`](./index.html) HTML file. To test it out from this repository, you should run an HTTP server and open up `index.html`. (Consider using [quickhttp](https://github.com/jayqi/quickhttp), a wrapper around `python -m http.server` with some advantages.)
