At DrivenData, our goal has always been to bring the capabilities of machine learning and data science to bear on solving important problems facing society. That is why we have been especially excited to follow the recent breakthroughs in generative machine learning and large language models. Artificial intelligence chatbots like [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) and [Bard](https://bard.google.com/) can respond to prompts and questions with unprecedented relevance and accuracy. But we believe that this technology can be used for so much more than helping us [to avoid writing emails](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/07/salesforce-launches-chatgpt-slack-app-einstein-gpt-for-sales-service.html) or [to imagine new crochet patterns](https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-crochet-tiktokers-uncovered-chatgpts-kryptonite). That is why DrivenData is introducing a new AI chatbot to evaluate submitted predictions for all of our competitions going forward.
